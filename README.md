# Description
This project demonstrate an automation of simulation of the research article.

This code is for both the objectives discussed in the paper. The code consists of two directries main and rdsmp. There are two shell script in the directries, each can be run seperately. 

The 1st obej: consists of Random, Binary search, K-Means and Simulated Annealing.

The 2nd obej: consists of LAF, rdsmp and erdsmp. 

The simulation is done as follows.

We show average number of drivers found and with different number of drivers. we also show average number of drivers found using threshold value.

$ ls

$ make cleanall

$ bash runsim.sh

$ ls

You will see a .pdf files for both the objectives. Please repeat the same for other directory as well. 

Note: Simulation will take time please wait untill fininsh.
